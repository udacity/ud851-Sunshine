  - This layout displays the complete details of a given day's weather, including the date, a    -
  - weather icon and description, the high and low temperature, the humidity, pressure, and the  -
  - wind speed and direction.                                                                    -

  - In order to use Android's data binding capabilities, (to avoid having to type findViewById   -
  - over and over again) we wrap this layout in a <layout></layout> tag.                         -
  -                                                                                              -
  - Note that this is the PORTRAIT version of the layout.                                        -
